# gemma3-rocm-api

Hello there! Hannah here!
Basically I want to run Gemma 3 right? So this container is for hosting a OpenAI api using Gemma 3 inside a rocm standard docker container! Welcome to the wonderful world of working around the fact that everything is built for NIVIDIA!

Yeah, but basically. This is a rocm based container for a Open Ai API interfaced Gemma 3 instance. Have fun!
